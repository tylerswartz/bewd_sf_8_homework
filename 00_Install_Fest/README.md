# BEWD Installfest

We are going to install the tools necessarily to program with Ruby and Rails on your computer.

If you are unsure or run into problems during installation, don't worry; We will finish up any of the loose ends during Class Zero.


## Verify your install

If you have already experimented with ruby or rails before, verify your versions are correct for this upcoming class. If you can see the correct version numbers when you run the commands in Terminal below, you are good to go. 

**Verify you are running 2.2 of ruby**

`ruby -v`

Should be "ruby 2.2" (other versions above 2.2.0 are acceptable)

**Verify you are running version 3 of Rails**

`rails -v`

Should be "rails 4.2". If you do not have the correct version of Ruby or Rails, follow the instructions below to install it, or ask an instructor to help you.

# Windows Instructions

**Installing Ruby**

The install on Windows is actually very with the bundle from http://rubyinstaller.org

Just be sure to grab the 2.2.0 version, as that will be the version we will be using in class. This will set up your environment and you can start running ruby files right away.

**Installing Rails**

`gem install rails -v 4.2`

**Installing Gow**

We will be using the command line a lot here. Gow is a bunch of unix command line tools ported to Windows. It will make it easy to follow in class with the same commands as your Mac buddies.
